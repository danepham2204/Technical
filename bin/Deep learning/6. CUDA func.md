1. cudaMalloc (assign memory for gpu pointer)
2. cudaMemcpy (copy from right to left (host to device) - (device to host))

// struct dim3 {
unsigned int x;// default 1
unsigned int y;
unsigned int z;
}

When a warp (32 threads) accesses memory together:

If the 32 threads are reading/writing "consecutive" columns in the same row → coalesced access (very fast)
If they are reading/writing the same column across different rows → strided access (much slower — 32× worse bandwidth in worst case)

col first for faster reading in 2D

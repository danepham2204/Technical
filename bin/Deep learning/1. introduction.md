- Cutting through the hype and giving you a realistic 13 to 22 US dollars is predicted to come to what's called generative AI, which is relatively new type of AI technology that produce high quality.
- Artificial Intelligence (AI): The broad field of creating machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence (e.g., reasoning, planning, or recognizing patterns).
- Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI that uses data to "learn" and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.
- Generative AI: A specific, newer subset of Machine Learning focused on creating new content rather than just analyzing existing data.

- There are three forms of AI being:
+ ANI (artificial narrow intelligence)
+ Generative AI
+ AGI (artificial general intelligence)
